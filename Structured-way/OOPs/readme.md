## OOPS in C++
- C++ Language was designed with the main intention of adding object-oriented features to C language.
- As the size of the porgram increases, readability, maintainibility and bug-free nature of program decreases.
- This was the major problem with languages like C which relied upon functions or procedures(hence the name procedural programming language).
- As a result, The possibility of not addressing the problem in an effective manner was high.
- Also, as data was almost neglected, data security was easily compromised.
- Using classes solves this problem by modelling program as a real world scenario.
 
 ------------------------------
 ### Procedure oriented programming
 - Conists of writing a set of instructions for the computer to follow
 - Main focus is on functions and not on flow of data
 - Functions can either use local or global data
 - Data moves openly from function to function

 ### Object oriented programming
 - Works on the concept of classes and objects
 - A class is a template to create objects
 - Treats data as critical element
 - Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects

 
 ------------------------------
 ## Basic concepts in OOPS
 - Classes: Basic template for creating objects
 - Objects: Basic run time entities
 - Data Abstraction & Encapsulation: Wrapping data and fucntions into single unit
 - Inheritance: Properties of one class can be inherited into other class
 - Polymorphism: Ability to take more than one forms
 - Dynamic binding: Code which will execute is not known until the program runs
 - Message passing: Object.message(information) call format
 
 ------------------------------
 ## Benefits of OOP
 - Better code reusability using objects and inheritance
 - Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems
 - Multiple objects can co-exist without any interference
 - Software complexity can be easily managed
