### Classes vs Structures
- Initially "C++" was called "C with classes".
- A class is the extension of structure (in C).
- Structure in C++ are typedefed by default.
- Structure had various limitations like:
    - Members are public.
    - No methods are allowed.
- Classes are simply - structures with more functioanlity.
- Classes can have methods and properties.
- Classes can make few members as private & few as public.
- We can declare objects along with the class declaration.
- The private members of a class can only be accessed
    - with getter or setter methods.
- Neseting of member function is possible in classes.
