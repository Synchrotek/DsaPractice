## Let's Start
- C++ Language was designed with the main intention of adding object-oriented features to C language.
- As the size of the porgram increases, readability, maintainibility and bug-free nature of program decreases.
- This was the major problem with languages like C which relied upon functions or procedures(hence the name procedural programming language).
- As a result, The possibility of not addressing the problem in an effective manner was high.
- Also, as data was almost neglected, data security was easily compromised.
- Using classes solves this problem by modelling program as a real world scenario.
